This repository investigates the possibility to improve Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) by using Dyadic filtering of IQ signals in combination with AI.

For additional information see the Poster : Poster_MdC_AG.pdf

The initial code can be found under: dyadic_s_fusion.py

The used Dataset is the Machine-Learning Challenge [CSPB.ML.2018] of Chad Spooners cyclostationary.blog.
The Dataset is originally composed of matlab binary .tim files, these have been aggregated and converted to the more common .h5 file called spooner_full.h5 in the code.
